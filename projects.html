      <h3>Project Works & Weekend Meetings and Support Sessions</h3>
      <p>Project-based learning is a cornerstone of She Learns, She Teaches, encouraging women to work on projects that showcase their skills and creativity. From community-focused initiatives to entrepreneurial projects, women have the opportunity to develop portfolios that can be used to gain employment or start businesses. Projects are collaborative, with guidance from mentors, enabling women to put their knowledge into action and achieve meaningful outcomes.To build a sense of community and offer additional support, we hold weekend meetings and group sessions where women can connect, share experiences, and receive guidance from mentors and peers. These meetings create a supportive network that helps each woman stay motivated, find answers to her questions, and discuss progress on her educational journey. Weekend sessions also include special workshops on topics like financial literacy, health, and personal growth.</p>
